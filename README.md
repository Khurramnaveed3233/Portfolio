# Financial Sales Analysis Report – Dashboard Insights

Welcome everyone! This dashboard provides a comprehensive summary of our financial sales performance across different years, segments, countries, and products. I’ve built this report in Power BI to help decision-makers like you easily understand key trends and business insights at a glance — without needing to dive into raw data.

🔹 5. Profit by Product:
