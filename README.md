###  About Me

I am Khurram Naveed, a passionate Data Analyst and Business Intelligence Specialist with a proven track record in creating compelling dashboards and insightful visualizations using Excel, Power BI, and SQL. 

Over the years, I have built and delivered projects ranging from sales performance and HR analysis dashboards to healthcare data insights and global terrorism analysis, leveraging data to drive informed business decisions.

During my role at TCS Courier Service, I demonstrated my analytical and problem-solving skills by managing and tracking over 1,000 daily shipments, ensuring timely deliveries, and implementing a retail software system that boosted efficiency by 20%. 

Additionally, I took ownership of department expenses, uncovering cost-saving opportunities and achieving a 15% reduction in daily costs.

My technical expertise includes advanced Excel functions like pivot tables, VLOOKUP, and INDEX/MATCH, as well as proficiency in DAX for complex calculations and data modeling. I am also adept at using Power Query for data cleaning, transformation, and integration from various sources, ensuring data quality and reliability for comprehensive BI reports.

I am certified in Google Data Analytics, Data Analytics & BI from Digiskills. pk, and having completed a Virtual Experience Program with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., I have the skills to handle data complexities and translate them into actionable insights for stakeholders.

I hold a Bachelor's in Arts from Bahauddin Zikrya University, which provided me with a strong foundation in analytical thinking. I am now actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in data analysis and visualization to support organizations in making impactful data-driven decisions.

Open to learning and collaborating on emerging technologies, real-world projects, and internship opportunities in data analytics, and business intelligence . Let’s connect and grow together.
